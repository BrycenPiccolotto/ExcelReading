This program is designed as a companion piece to FinHealth calculator. This code gathers data from an excel sheet loaded onto your computer with the program to then place all of that data onto a new excel file called SystemData.xlsx.

This file is designed to be used as a comparison tool, as you can hold the data within it over multiple runs of the program and compare many different companies data to compare and contrast their strengths and weaknesses in each respective field.

You can change the data in DataEntrySheet by oppening the file in Microsoft Excel, changing the sample companies to your own data, saving the file to the same spot, and running the program again

You can use your own Excel Sheet for the data entry, but please insure that the data entry fields are the same as those on "DataEntrySheet.xlsx" or the program will not read the data correctly

Caution:
Please do not change the information in any file other than "DataEntrySheet.xlsx"
Please do not change the location of any of the files unless you are moving the entire folder, in which case you will have to re-enter the file location upon running the program
